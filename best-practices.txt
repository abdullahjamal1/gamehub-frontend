* always minimize use of refs

headers which start with x-
like x-auth-token are custom tokens

jwt consists of header-payload and verify signature

// puts x-auth-token in the header of every http request

axios.defaults.headers.common['x-auth-token'] = auth.getJwt();

always get rid of bidirectional dependencies
